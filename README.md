Project trying to make an updated version of Goodreads. Mainly for me to practice using React and Typescript, but also using Cursor as my IDE and AI aid. 

The goal is to create the idea of a new Goodreads called BookMark (name will probably change). Whether it will be a full service remains to be seen, but for now just working on creating a full stack project where I can learn more of React, Typescript, PostgreSQL, authentication, and possibly running it live (at the very least creating a prototype).
